'''
Indeed, Flask's built-in server is a development only server, and should not be used in production.

From the official deployment documentation:

When running publicly rather than in development, you should not use the built-in development server (flask run). The development server is provided by Werkzeug for convenience but is not designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure.

You can use any python production web server (tornado, gunicorn, â€¦) instead.
